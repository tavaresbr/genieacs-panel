## [1.11.0] - 2026-07-24

### New

- Added customer self-service controls for changing the SSID and WiFi password reported by each ONT.
- Added encrypted recovery of the last password changed through the portal, with explicit eye controls for on-demand reveal.

### Fixed

- Normalized GenieACS boolean variants so enabled WiFi radios no longer appear disabled in the operator panel or customer portal.

### Security

- Bound every portal WiFi mutation and password reveal to the authenticated customer account, with dedicated rate limits and no client-supplied device target.
- Protected saved WiFi passwords with AES-256-GCM and kept decrypted values out of overview responses and process caches.
