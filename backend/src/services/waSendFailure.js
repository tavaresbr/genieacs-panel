/**
 * Sorting a failed send into "try again" and "never".
 *
 * Burning the retry window is right for a server that is down and wrong for a
 * number that does not exist: the first costs a message a few minutes, the
 * second keeps a row in the queue for the best part of an hour to reach a phone
 * that will never answer.
 *
 * WHEN IN DOUBT, TRANSIENT. Erring that way costs a message that goes out late;
 * erring the other way is a dunning notice that never arrives and nobody
 * notices, because a `failed` row is visible only inside its own thread. So
 * everything below is a list of the failures that can be NAMED as permanent,
 * and anything unrecognised falls through to a retry.
 *
 * ── Why the server's words are read as one string ──────────────────────
 *
 * "Evolution" is two servers that agree about very little. A refused send comes
 * back from v2 as a nested `{status, error, response: {message: [...]}}` and
 * from Evolution GO as a flat `{"error": "..."}`. `evolutionClient.sendOrThrow`
 * has already flattened whichever arrived into `translationVars.body` with
 * `JSON.stringify`, so one regex over that text reads both — which is what
 * `evolutionInstanceService` does with ALREADY_EXISTS, QR_PENDING and
 * NO_SESSION rather than keeping two parsers of two shapes in step.

/**
 * Failures that are about this message rather than about the server.
 *
 * `no_destination` is the invalid number: the thread carries neither a phone
 * nor a LID, so every attempt would compose the same request to nowhere.
 *
 * It is deliberately the only one. `no_account` (no number connected) and
 * `no_public_url` (nothing has told the panel its own address) look permanent
 * and are not — a number reconnects, a setting gets filled in, and the message
 * itself was sendable the whole time. `unauthorized` and `license_required` are
 * the same story with a different fix.
