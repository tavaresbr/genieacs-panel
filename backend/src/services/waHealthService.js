/**
 * One read that answers "is this working?".
 *
 * Everything else on this surface answers a question about ONE thing — this
 * conversation, this campaign, this number. That is exactly why the integration
 * can be dead for two days without anybody noticing: a failed message is
 * visible only inside its own thread, and a queue that stopped moving is
 * visible nowhere at all. The operator finds out when a customer complains.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TWO NUMBERS CARRY THE MEANING, AND BOTH ARE ABOUT TIME
 *
 * `outbox.oldestQueuedAt` and `lastInboundAt`. Volume cannot say what either
 * of them says:
 *
 *   - Forty messages queued is a busy afternoon if the oldest is a minute old,
 *     and the panel gone silent if the oldest is from yesterday. The COUNT is
 *     the same number in both worlds; only the timestamp separates them.
 *   - An empty queue with nothing arriving for two days is not calm. It is a
 *     dead webhook — and the queue, being empty, looks perfect.
 *
 * So both are read even though both cost an extra query, and the strip is
 * built to say them out loud rather than render them as another counter.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * CHEAP ON PURPOSE
 *
 * This is a screen that polls. `wa_messages` is the biggest table in the panel,
 * and a health read that scans it becomes the reason the panel is slow — which
 * would make this module the thing it exists to detect.
 *
 * So every query here is an EQUALITY on the leading column of an index that
 * already exists, and nothing pulls rows to count them:
 *
 *   - `wa_messages.index(['delivery_status', 'created_at'])` — the outbox
 *     worker's own index — serves `queued`, `sending`, `oldestQueuedAt` and
 *     `failed24h`. The first three touch only the queue, which is small by
 *     definition (a large one is the alarm). `failed24h` adds a range on
 *     `created_at`, the index's second column, so the 24 h window is a seek
 *     rather than a scan of every failure the panel ever had.
 *   - The inbox figures and `lastInboundAt` come from `wa_conversations`,
 *     which is smaller than `wa_messages` by however many messages a thread
 *     holds, and which already maintains `last_inbound_at` on every inbound
 *     (`waInboundService`). Deriving it from `wa_messages` instead would mean
 *     ordering by a column with no index on the table we must not scan.
 *
 * `lastOutboundAt` is the one figure with no column of its own, and it is read
 * as three indexed lookups rather than one `whereIn` — see `lastOutboundAt()`.
 */

/**
 * Counts, and the disagreement `waBotService` chose to avoid.
 *
 * That module has a comment about this: the three engines disagree about
 * whether `COUNT(*)` comes back a number or a string — SQLite and Postgres and
 * MySQL do not answer alike, and Postgres returns a bigint that the driver
 * hands over as a STRING so it cannot silently lose precision. The bot could
 * dodge it by pulling the handful of ids it needed; a health read cannot,
 * because the whole point is not to pull rows.
 *
 * So it is handled here, explicitly and in one place. Without this, `queued`
 * arrives at the strip as `"40"`, `queued > 0` is still true, and everything
 * looks fine — until `"40" + 0` renders as "400", or a comparison against a
 * threshold sorts lexically and decides 9 is larger than 40.

   * `attachment_name` and NOT a size, so the only place the byte count exists
   * is the filesystem. Counting it means a `stat` per file, and a panel that
   * has been running a year has as many attachment files as its subscribers
   * sent photos. Doing that on every poll of a screen left open in a background
   * tab is precisely the "health strip becomes the reason the panel is slow"
   * failure — so it is NOT done on every poll:
   *
   *   - A reading is kept per provider for `MEDIA_TTL_MS`, which is longer than
   *     the strip's own poll interval. Between refreshes the poll costs nothing
   *     at all.
   *   - When it goes stale the PREVIOUS reading is returned immediately and the
   *     walk runs behind the response. Only the very first read after boot
   *     waits for the disk, because that one has nothing to serve instead.
   *   - A refresh already in flight is never started twice.
   *
   * The staleness is honest: this is a disk-usage figure whose consumer is a
   * line of text, and it is five minutes old at worst. Nothing decides anything
   * on it. Deleting the old files belongs to the media sweeper — this only
   * counts.
   *
   * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   * PROVIDER SCOPING, WHICH THE DISK DOES NOT DO FOR US
   *
   * There are two shapes on disk and they are scoped by different means.
   *
   * Everything written since wave 8 lives under `wa-media/t<id>/`, and there
   * the path itself is the provider: the subtree is walked whole, with no
   * lookup, because nothing else can have put a file in it.
   *
   * Everything written before it lives at `wa-media/<conversationId>/<file>`,
   * where the path carries no provider at all. Two providers on one panel share
   * that area, so walking it wholesale would report the neighbour's photos as
   * this one's — not a leak of content, but a wrong number on the one screen
   * whose whole job is to be believed. Those directory names ARE conversation
   * ids, so they are filtered through `wa_conversations` — a primary-key lookup
   * `tdb` has already scoped — and only the surviving ones are walked. Chunked,
   * because the id list is as long as the panel has threads with attachments.
   *
   * The legacy area is read here even on a panel with several providers, which
   * is the opposite of what the sweep does with it, and for a reason that only
   * looks contradictory: this read counts and the sweep deletes. The ownership
   * lookup is exact for a file that has a row, so counting is safe; a file with
   * no row is counted by nobody here, while deleting it would need an answer to
   * "whose was it?" that the path cannot give.
