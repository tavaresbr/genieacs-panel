/**
 * The second thing in this integration that deletes, and the heavier of the two.
 *
 * `wa_messages` never lost a row. On an installation that fires a campaign at
 * thousands of contracts that table only grows, and it is already the largest
 * one the panel has — so the disk the media sweep is trying to reclaim fills
 * again from the other side, in rows instead of files.
 *
 * What the media sweep deletes is a file, and the message survives it with its
 * words intact. What this deletes is the words. That difference is why every
 * limit below leans the same way:
 *
 * - It NEVER deletes a `queued` or `sending` row. That is a message still on
 *   its way out; deleting it makes an operator's reply vanish between being
 *   typed and being sent, and nothing anywhere would say why. Age is not the
 *   question here, exactly as in the media sweep — whether it has gone out is.
 * - It NEVER deletes a row that still has `attachment_path` set.
 * - It NEVER deletes a `wa_conversations` row. That row holds the phone↔contact
 *   binding, so deleting it loses whose conversation this was — and it saves no
 *   disk at all, because there is one of them per THREAD and the rows that
 *   actually accumulate are the ones below it.
 *
 * That second rule is what ties the two retentions together without either
 * module reaching into the other's data. `WaMediaSweeper` is the only thing
 * that unlinks a file, and it nulls `attachment_path` when it does; only then
 * does the row become eligible here. So with attachment retention OFF, a
 * message carrying an attachment stays forever — which is not an oversight,
 * it is precisely what "keep the attachments forever" means. A row whose file
 * is still on disk cannot be deleted without orphaning those bytes, and the
 * only thing that knows they are gone is the module that removed them.
 *
 * With `messageRetentionDays` at 0 it deletes nothing and says so. Zero is the
 * default, for the same reason it is the media sweep's: the setting arrives at
 * installations that already have years of history, and dropping a provider's
 * conversations because they upgraded the panel would be the panel destroying
 * evidence nobody asked it to touch.

 * pass bounds how much a bug in it can take before somebody notices.
