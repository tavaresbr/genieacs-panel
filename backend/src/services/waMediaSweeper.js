/**
 * The only thing in this integration that deletes.
 *
 * Nothing else ever does: every attachment that arrives and every one the
 * operator sends is written under `DATA_DIR/wa-media/` and stays there, with no
 * quota and no count. On a provider with movement that grows on its own, and
 * the disk it fills is the same one SQLite writes to — so the panel does not
 * get slow, it stops.
 *
 * What the sweep may touch is deliberately narrow, and each limit is a rule
 * somebody would otherwise learn the hard way:
 *
 * - It deletes the FILE and clears that row's `attachment_*` columns. The
 *   message stays in the thread with its text intact and the bubble says the
 *   attachment is no longer on disk, which is true and already has a screen.
 * - It NEVER deletes a message row. Conversation history is what a provider
 *   needs when a customer disputes a charge; disk is what they need when it
 *   fills. Only one of those is this module's problem.
 * - It NEVER deletes a file a `queued` or `sending` message still has to send.
 *   The row's age is irrelevant: what matters is whether it has gone out.
 *   Deleting there turns a pending send into a permanent failure, and the
 *   operator who attached the file never finds out why.
 * - A file with no row pointing at it is an abandoned upload — the operator
 *   who attached a photo and closed the tab — and goes by the same age rule.
 * - It only ever looks inside the subtree of the provider whose pass is
 *   running. What "orphan" means depends entirely on which rows were read, and
 *   the rows are one provider's; a file outside that subtree has no row here
 *   because it was never this provider's to have one.
 *
 * With `mediaRetentionDays` at 0 it deletes nothing and says so. Zero is the
 * default, and that default is not laziness: the setting arrives at
 * installations that already have files, and deleting a provider's history
 * because they updated the panel would be the panel destroying data nobody
 * asked it to touch.
