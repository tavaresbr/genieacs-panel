 * The operator's half of the attachment story: `GET /api/whatsapp/messages/:id/media`.
 *
 * Session-authenticated and provider-scoped like everything else under
 * `/api/whatsapp`, which is what makes it a different route from the signed one
 * the Evolution server uses. The two must not merge: this one answers to a
 * human with a session and no token, that one to a server with a token and no
 * session, and the only reason either is safe is that neither accepts the
 * other's credential.
 *
 * What the request may say about the file is: which message. Nothing else. The
 * path is read from the row, and `resolveStoredAttachment` confines it to
 * `DATA_DIR` before anything is opened.
