  /**
   * Public endpoint SGP posts to. It is mounted before the global JSON parser
   * so the signature is computed over the exact bytes that were signed; the
   * body is only parsed once the signature checks out.
   *
   * The provider is the RESULT of the signature check, never an input to it.
   *
   * This route is public and sits under `resolveTenant`, which — until
   * providers are reached by host — answers with the first provider for every
   * request. Reading the webhook secret from that scope meant the endpoint
   * could only ever authenticate provider #1: a second ISP's SGP had no way to
   * deliver anything at all, and scoping `sgp_events` without settling that
   * would have moved the failure rather than ended it.
   *
   * The Evolution webhook already solves the same problem here, by resolving
   * its account from the instance name in the payload before the scope opens
   * (`WhatsAppAccount.getByName`). This is that shape with a different
   * identifier, and the difference is deliberate: SGP is configured with a URL
   * and a shared secret and nothing else, so there is no field an integrator
   * could be asked to fill in that would name the provider — and inventing one
   * would put an unauthenticated, caller-chosen provider selector in front of
   * an HMAC check. The signature is the identifier instead. The delivery is
   * verified against each candidate's own secret under that candidate's own
   * timestamp policy, and the provider whose secret verifies IS the provider.
   * A signature that cannot be produced without a secret cannot name the wrong
   * owner of it.
   *
   * What an unauthenticated caller CAN learn from this endpoint: whether
   * somebody on this deployment has SGP delivery enabled — 404 while nobody
   * does, 401 once anybody does. That is exactly what it already told a prober
   * when there was one provider, and the 404 is kept because it is what stops
   * a survey of panels from noticing SGP here at all.
   *
   * What it CANNOT learn: how many providers exist, which of them uses SGP, or
   * anything that tells them apart. Nothing in the request names a provider and
   * no answer varies by one — every delivery that does not verify gets the same
   * 401 with the same code, and every candidate is tried on every request, so
   * neither the response nor the work behind it depends on which provider a
   * body was aimed at. It also learns nothing about a contract, document or
   * login: none of that is read before the signature verifies.
   *
   * And what it CANNOT do: have one provider's secret admit another provider's
   * payload. The row is filed under whoever's secret signed those bytes, and
   * there is no claimed identity for that to disagree with. Writing into
   * provider B's log still requires B's secret, exactly as before.
   *
   * Two providers holding the SAME secret are refused rather than guessed at.
   * The delivery is genuinely ambiguous, and taking the lower-numbered one
   * would write an ISP's subscriber data into another ISP's log; an operator
   * has to rotate one of them. It is logged loudly for that reason.
   *
   * The cost is one HMAC per candidate per delivery over a body already capped
   * at 64 kB, behind `sgpWebhookLimiter`. If a deployment ever carries enough
   * providers for that to matter, the answer is a routing hint minted by the
   * panel and shown next to the URL in Settings — not a hint the sender is
   * trusted to invent.
