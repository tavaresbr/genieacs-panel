/**
 * Authenticated encryption for secrets that an operator must be able to read
 * back (customer WiFi passwords, customer portal passwords, the SGP token).
 * Each context string derives an independent key, so a ciphertext from one
 * feature can never be decrypted as another.
 *
 * Every ciphertext records the key version that produced it. Without that,
 * rotating the base secret turns every stored secret into an unreadable blob
 * and `decrypt` reports it by returning null — a silent, irreversible data
 * loss triggered by an otherwise routine security operation.
 *
 * Version 1 derives from JWT_SECRET and is what every row written before this
 * release used. Version 2 derives from the dedicated SECRET_BOX_KEY. An install
 * that sets SECRET_BOX_KEY writes version 2 and can still read version 1, which
 * is what makes JWT_SECRET rotatable.
 *
 * That covered NEW writes and not the rows already stored, because version 1's
 * key is still derived from whatever JWT_SECRET currently is: rotating it left
 * every not-yet-rewritten portal password, WiFi password and stored token
 * unreadable, and quietly — `decrypt` answers null, and on the portal
 * `hasSavedPassword` still reports true because it only tests that the
 * ciphertext columns are filled. So it presented to the subscriber as data that
 * had vanished rather than as a key that was missing.
 *
 * `JWT_SECRET_PREVIOUS` and `SECRET_BOX_KEY_PREVIOUS` are the read-side overlap
 * that makes a rotation survivable: each version accepts more than one key, the
 * first is what writes, and the rest are only ever tried on the way in. Set the
 * old value there, rotate the live one, and every row stays readable until it
 * is next written — which is what moves it onto the new key.
