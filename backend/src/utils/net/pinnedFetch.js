/**
 * The one transport every outbound request whose destination came from data
 * goes through: resolve with the resolver the socket will actually use, check
 * every answer against `blockedRanges.js`, then connect to the address that was
 * checked and to no other, reading at most a stated number of bytes back.
 *
 * Three separate holes closed by putting it in one place.
 *
 * The first is the split resolver. `ssrfGuard` validated a hostname with
 * `dns.resolve4`/`dns.resolve6` — the DNS protocol — and then handed the NAME to
 * `fetch`, which resolves through `getaddrinfo`. Those are different resolvers
 * answering from different sources: `/etc/hosts`, a Compose `extra_hosts:`, a
 * container name, NSS, mDNS. Everything the system resolver knows and DNS does
 * not was validated as public and then connected to as private. With
 * `127.0.0.1 vm` in `/etc/hosts`, `http://vm/` passed the check and reached
 * loopback. `dns.lookup` is `getaddrinfo`, so the answer that is vetted here is
 * the answer the connection would have got.
 *
 * The second is the gap between checking and connecting. Vetting a name and
 * then letting an HTTP client resolve it a second time closes nothing: the two
 * answers need not agree, and whoever controls the zone makes sure they do not.
 * So the address vetted here is the address connected to — pinned through the
 * `lookup` hook, with the original hostname still in the `Host` header and in
 * the TLS SNI so the certificate check stays honest. Node's global `fetch`
 * cannot express that: it takes no resolver, and `Host` is a forbidden header
 * there, so pointing it at the vetted IP would silently send the wrong name.
 * That is why this is `node:http`/`node:https` and not `fetch`.
 *
 * The third is the unbounded read. Buffering an answer with no ceiling means
 * the far end chooses this process's memory: a 200 MiB body took RSS from
 * 62 MB to 1133 MB. Every caller now states a ceiling; over it, the socket is
 * destroyed and the call rejects rather than returning a truncated body that
 * something downstream would try to parse.
 *
 * Nothing here follows a redirect. A 3xx arrives as an ordinary not-ok
 * response, which is what a caller that must not be redirected wants, and what
 * a caller that may follow one (`safeFetch`) needs in order to re-vet the next
 * hop itself.
