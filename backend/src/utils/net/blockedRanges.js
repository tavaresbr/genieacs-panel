/**
 * One table of the addresses the panel may not be sent to, for every outbound
 * path that takes a destination from data rather than from code.
 *
 * There used to be two. `utils/wa/ssrfGuard.js` guarded the WhatsApp side and
 * `services/genieacsEgress.js` the ACS side, and neither was a superset of the
 * other: the WhatsApp one understood 6to4 and the 192.0.0.0/16 assignments and
 * missed IPv6 multicast; the ACS one had multicast and missed both of those.
 * A blocklist that disagrees with its sibling is a blocklist with a hole in it,
 * and which hole you fall through depended only on which feature you reached.
 * So the ranges live here, once, and both modules classify through this file.
 *
 * The list is the strict union of what the two blocked between them:
 *
 *   IPv4
 *     0.0.0.0/8         the unspecified "this network" block
 *     10.0.0.0/8        RFC 1918
 *     100.64.0.0/10     carrier-grade NAT
 *     127.0.0.0/8       loopback
 *     169.254.0.0/16    link-local — where the cloud metadata service lives
 *     172.16.0.0/12     RFC 1918
 *     192.0.0.0/16      IETF protocol assignments and TEST-NET-1
 *     192.168.0.0/16    RFC 1918
 *     224.0.0.0/3       multicast and the reserved space above it
 *
 *   IPv6
 *     ::                the unspecified address
 *     ::1               loopback
 *     ::/96             IPv4-compatible        ─┐
 *     ::ffff:0:0/96     IPv4-mapped             │ classified by the IPv4 rules
 *     ::ffff:0:0:0/96   IPv4-translated         │ above, on the embedded address
 *     64:ff9b::/96      NAT64                   │
 *     2002::/16         6to4                   ─┘
 *     fc00::/7          unique local
 *     fe80::/10         link-local
 *     ff00::/8          multicast
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: 198.18.0.0/15 and TEST-NET-2/3 (198.51.100.0/24,
 * 203.0.113.0/24). Neither module blocked them — `isPrivateIPv4` catches
 * TEST-NET-1 only because 192.0.2.0/24 sits inside the 192.0.0.0/16 rule — and
 * the suites use 203.0.113.x as their stand-in for "a public host we never
 * actually dial". Adding them would be a new decision, not a union of two old
 * ones, and it would silently retarget every test that leans on that address.
 *
 * Whether these ranges are refused at all is the caller's decision, not this
 * file's: a self-hosted install reaches its own ACS on its own LAN, and
 * `genieacsEgress` says so by not asking. This module only answers "what is
 * this address".
