/**
 * The slug is the subdomain the panel will be reached at, so the rule is DNS's
 * rule and not a taste in identifiers:
 *
 *   - lowercase ASCII letters, digits and hyphens only;
 *   - first and last character alphanumeric, so no leading or trailing hyphen;
 *   - 3 to 63 characters, 63 being the maximum length of a DNS label.
 *
 * Uppercase is REJECTED rather than lowered, and a stray space rejected rather
 * than trimmed, because whoever creates the provider is about to tell an ISP
 * the address of their panel. A slug that is silently rewritten means the
 * address they were given is not the address they typed, and they find that out
 * from a browser that cannot resolve it. Refusing costs one retry and says
 * exactly what is wrong.
 *
 * Shared by the console and by self-signup, so the two cannot drift: an ISP
 * that signed up on its own has to get the same address rule as one we minted.
