/**
 * The credential on `GET /api/whatsapp-media/:id`.
 *
 * That route is fetched by the Evolution server, which has no session and no
 * cookie: the only thing it carries is what the panel put in the URL when it
 * despatched the message. So the URL itself is the credential, and everything
 * that makes it safe to hand out lives here — one place, because the outbox
 * mints and the route verifies, and a signer and a verifier that drift apart
 * fail open rather than closed.
 *
 * The key is derived from `JWT_SECRET` under a context string of its own, the
 * same construction `secretBox.js` uses for stored secrets. A dedicated
 * derivation is not ceremony: `JWT_SECRET` used raw as an HMAC key here would
 * mean a media link and a session token are signed by the same key, and the
 * whole point of a per-context key is that a weakness in one use can never be
 * spent on another.
 *
 * There is no key VERSION here, unlike `secretBox`, and deliberately: a link
 * lives fifteen minutes. Rotating the base secret invalidates whatever is in
 * flight, the outbox mints a new link on the next attempt, and there is nothing
 * stored to read back and so nothing to lose.

 * a customer's file readable by anyone who ever saw the URL, in a proxy log or
 * a server's own access log, for as long as the file exists.
