/**
 * Who works for which provider, from the control plane.
 *
 * Mounted at `/api/platform`, alongside the router that mints and suspends
 * providers, and only where `EDITION=saas`: on a self-hosted install these
 * paths do not answer 403, they do not exist, because a 403 tells whoever asked
 * that a control plane is there.
 *
 * Two guards, in this order and never one without the other.
 * `authenticateToken` establishes WHO is asking — and, as a side effect, opens
 * the scope of the provider that caller's own session belongs to, which is not
 * the provider these routes act on; the controller takes that from the path.
 * `requirePlatformAdmin` then establishes that they are above providers rather
 * than inside one. A provider's own administrator passes the first and must
 * fail the second: reaching into another ISP's staff list is exactly the power
 * this plane exists to keep away from them.
