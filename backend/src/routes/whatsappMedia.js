 * caller is a server, not a person clicking: a campaign that attaches a file
 * fetches once per recipient, in a burst, and a bucket sized for a human would
 * turn that into a queue of failed sends. The bucket is still there, and keyed
 * by source address, because the address is what a flood comes from and this
 * route reads files off the disk.
 *
 * Lower than the webhook's 600: one fetch per outbound attachment is a far
 * quieter shape than one delivery receipt per recipient per state.
