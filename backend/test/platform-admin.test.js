/**
 * Who holds the control plane, and what the guard says to everybody else.
 *
 * Wave 13 adds a privilege that is not a role: `users.role` and the membership's
 * role both answer "what may you do at this provider", and neither can ever
 * answer "you may mint providers". So what has to be proved here is mostly a
 * set of refusals — that being an administrator at an ISP reaches nothing new,
 * that a grant withdrawn is gone at the next request rather than at the next
 * hour, and that the migration's empty table stays empty on an install that has
 * no control plane to hand out.
 *
 * The edition is chosen before the harness pulls the application in, exactly as
 * `edition-saas.test.js` does it: `edition.js` reads the environment at import,
 * static imports are hoisted, and `node --test` gives this file its own
 * process. This file runs as the HOSTED edition, because that is the one where
 * the control plane exists; the self-hosted half of the bootstrap contract is
 * proved in a child process below, which is the only honest way to have two
 * editions in one run.
