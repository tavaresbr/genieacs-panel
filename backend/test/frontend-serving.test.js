/**
 * The panel serving its own build.
 *
 * The build directory is deliberately created under a DOT SEGMENT, because that
 * is the case that broke: `res.sendFile` refuses an absolute path containing a
 * segment beginning with a dot, so an install under `/opt/.apps/panel` answered
 * 404 for every page — while its own assets, served by a different middleware,
 * loaded perfectly. Nothing looked wrong except that the panel would not open.
 *
 * `FRONTEND_DIR` is read when `app.js` is imported, so it has to be in place
 * before the harness pulls the app in; the import below is dynamic for that
 * reason, exactly like the harness's own.
